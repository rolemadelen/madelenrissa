# Stack


## Implement using Linked List
- [x] top()
- [x] isEmpty()
- [x] push(value)
- [x] pop()
- [x] Know the time complexity for each methods

### Stack
- A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
- The Last-In-First-Out principle states that the element which is inserted last is the first one to be removed.
- The stack operates on a specific end called the "top" of the stack.
- **Top**: The top of the stack refers to the position where the most recently added element is located.

- The implementation of the stack using a linked list does not require a tail pointer because the stack operations such as push and pop are performed on the top of the stack, so we only need to keep track of the topmost node.
